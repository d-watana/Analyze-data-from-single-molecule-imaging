# Single molecule imaging Data analysis
The acquired single-molecule imaging videos were analyzed using software from AAS (ZIDO, Japan). The analysis results before and after the addition of EGF have been included in the 'data' folder. Using the 'Analyze fluorescence intensity and diffusion.ipynb' notebook, you can obtain data related to the movement and brightness of single molecules, as demonstrated in the documentation.
